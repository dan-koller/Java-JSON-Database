# Java JSON Database

A client-server based database that handles and stores data in a JSON format. The original idea was based on a project
on a Jetbrains Academy track. I took this further and enhanced it mostly by styling the input and output format.

## Installation

Make sure to a [JVM](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) installed on your system. After that, download the files
provided with this package:

- `client.jar`
- `server.jar`

1. Start the server by double-clicking the `server.jar` file or running it from the
   commandline: 

```shell
java -jar /path/to/your/jar/server.jar
```
2. Start the `client.jar` from the commandline and pass the requested arguments. For example:
```shell
java -jar /path/to/your/jar/client.jar set -k "some key" -v "some value"
```

### CLI arguments

| Option            | Description                            |
|:------------------|:---------------------------------------|
| -t, --type        | Type of the request (set, get, delete) |
| -k, --key         | Record key                             |
| -v, --value       | Value to add                           |
| -in, --input-file | File containing the request as JSON*   |

_*) You can pass a JSON file by running the `client.jar` and pass `-in /path/to/your/file.json`_

## Features

- ü•∏ Human-readable data (should not be used for clear sensitive data)
- üñ• Multithreading (The server can handle multiple clients and request at a time)
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Lightweight and fast
