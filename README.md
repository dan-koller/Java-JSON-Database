# Java JSON Database

A client-server based database that handles and stores data in a JSON format. The original idea was based on a project
on a Jetbrains Academy track. I took this further and enhanced it mostly by styling the input and output format.

## Installation

Make sure to a [JVM](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) installed on your system. After that, download the files
provided with this package:

- `client.jar`
- `server.jar`

1. Start the server by double-clicking* the `server.jar` file or running it from the commandline:

```shell
java -jar /path/to/your/jar/server.jar
```

2. Start the `client.jar` from the commandline and pass the requested arguments. For example:

```shell
java -jar /path/to/your/jar/client.jar set -k "some key" -v "some value"
```

_*) It is **highly** recommended starting the server from the commandline for the first time. You will be prompted to
specify the path to your local database file. Please enter the absolute file path (e.g. `/path/to/your/db.json`) then
restart your server._

_If you want to specify a new path, just remove the path in the `app.config` located in the source directory of your app
file._

### CLI arguments

| Option            | Description                            |
|:------------------|:---------------------------------------|
| -t, --type        | Type of the request (set, get, delete) |
| -k, --key         | Record key                             |
| -v, --value       | Value to add                           |
| -in, --input-file | File containing the request as JSON*   |

_*) You can pass a JSON file by running the `client.jar` and pass `-in /path/to/your/file.json`_

## Features

- ü•∏ Human-readable data (should not be used for clear sensitive data)
- üñ• Multithreading (The server can handle multiple clients and request at a time)
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Lightweight and fast
